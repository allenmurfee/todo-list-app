  ## Description
  For our final class project we were assigned to create a MERN stack application from scratch. Our team chose to create a simple to-do list app called Listify. Our app provides a simple way for users to create and organize their to-do lists. From school projects to event planning to simple household chores - Listify makes it easy to arrange the users tasks as ‘haven’t started’, ‘in progress’, or ‘done’! Our app uses React on the front end, GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, and MongoDB for the database.
